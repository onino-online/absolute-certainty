      <h1>Absolute Certainty</h1>
      <h1>I</h1>
      <div class="stanza">
        <p>
          Where does absolute certainty lie?<br />
          It cannot be found in promises of men<br />
          For words may turn to ashes in your mouth…<br />
          And foe may be the one you thought was friend…
        </p>
        <p>
          The morality of man is changeable<br />
          As mutable and fickle as the wind…<br />
          The Master of Coin had two faces;<br />
          A virtuous mask disguised a heart of sin…
        </p>

        <p>
          Where does absolute certainty lie?<br />
          Ned Stark relied upon Petyr Baelish’s words<br />
          But at the crucial moment, his loyalty<br />
          Was as elusive as the eunuchs’ little birds…
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
          Absolute certainty lies not in words of men<br />
          Such faith is how Ned Stark met his end…
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>*</p>

      <div class="stanza">
        <p>
          Where does absolute certainty lie?<br />
          When everything may not be as it seems…<br />
          Where men change their faces like allegiances<br />
          When reality appears stranger than in dreams…
        </p>

        <p>
          The Game of Thrones is a deadly battle<br />
          A chess match of power, intellect and brawn,<br />
          Pawns may appear as Kings and Queens,<br />
          And Kings and Queens may appear as pawns…
        </p>

        <p>
          Where does absolute certainty lie?<br />
          Greyjoy’s liberty was his captor in disguise…<br />
          When Ser Meryn beat the “broken brothel girl”<br />
          Arya Stark slit his throat and took his eyes…
        </p>

        <p class="italic">
          Absolute certainty lies not in what you see<br />
          For veils of illusion obscure reality…
        </p>
      </div>

      <h1>II</h1>
      <div class="stanza">
        <p>Where does absolute certainty lie?</p>

        <p>
          In the beating heart beneath a mother’s breast?<br />
          For a mother loves her children endlessly<br />
          And protects them as fiercely as a lioness…
        </p>

        <p>
          Cersei was a fortress for her children<br />
          Her body was their first sanctuary and home<br />
          But the price she’d pay to keep them safe<br />
          Was more than she ever could have known…
        </p>

        <p>
          Where does absolute certainty lie?<br />
          It lies within a mother’s daring iron will<br />
          To protect and love her last surviving child<br />
          No matter how many innocent she has to kill…
        </p>

        <p class="italic">
          Absolute certainty lies in a mother’s sacred bond<br />
          That extends across the Kingdom and beyond…
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="stanza">
        <p>
          Where does absolute certainty lie?<br />
          It cannot be found on the righteous path…<br />
          The High Sparrow walked in the light of Gods…<br />
          And there he met the Devil’s deadly wrath…
        </p>

        <p>
          Do not doubt the fierceness of a mother<br />
          Especially not of a Lannister Lioness<br />
          The lengths she goes to protect her cubs…<br />
          Is no match for the Sparrows’ piousness
        </p>

        <p>
          Where does absolute certainty lie?<br />
          For nowhere in the Seven Kingdoms can it be found<br />
          Except in a mother’s will to survive<br />
          Even if it means burning her own city to the ground…
        </p>

        <p class="italic">
          Absolute certainty lies not in the righteous course…<br />
          For evil and darkness may be the stronger force…
        </p>
      </div>
      <h1>III</h1>
      <div class="stanza">
        <p>
          The High Sparrow may fly high…<br />
          But the Eagle Owl is the one that soars<br />
          It molts its feathers like a snake that sheds its skin…<br />
          Emerges like a Phoenix that transforms…
        </p>

        <p>
          The Eagle Owl is the one that transcends<br />
          Different places, realms and realities…<br />
          It comes at the night, fluttering its wings<br />
          And whispers softly to you in your dreams…
        </p>

        <p>
          It was a fate written in the winds of winter<br />
          That the High sparrow would eventually fall<br />
          For even though the Sparrow thought he won the battle<br />
          The Eagle Owl has the power to win the war
        </p>

        <p class="italic">
          A fateful darkness spreads across the land<br />
          Like a tide that casts itself against the sand…
        </p>

        <p>
          A lioness does not strike when prey is near…<br />
          She watches from the shadows patiently<br />
          And when she makes her swift attack<br />
          Her sharpened claws will cause fatalities…
        </p>

        <p>
          Her deadly act was almost mad as Aerys<br />
          The wild and vicious king who went insane<br />
          But if you imprison a lioness— fear her…<br />
          If she ever breaks free from her cage…
        </p>

        <p>
          Black smoke coalesces like dreams<br />
          Embers rise like a thousand vermillion prayers<br />
          The Sept of Baylor lies in destruction<br />
          The lives of the innocent were not be spared
        </p>

        <p class="italic">
          And so the Eagle Owl takes its silent flight…<br />
          The only path is the way of the Seven’s light…
